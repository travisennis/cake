# Agent Skills

This document describes the skills system that provides specialized instructions to the AI agent on demand.

## Overview

Skills are self-contained instruction modules stored as `SKILL.md` files. They allow the agent to access domain-specific knowledge (debugging procedures, evaluation criteria, workflow instructions) only when needed, rather than embedding all possible knowledge in the initial prompt.

The system has three phases:

1. **Discovery**: Find `SKILL.md` files in `.agents/skills/` directories
2. **Catalog disclosure**: List discovered skills in an initial developer context message
3. **Activation**: The model reads a `SKILL.md` via the `Read` tool when its description matches the task

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.agents/skills/
  debugging-cake/
    SKILL.md
  evaluating-cake/
    SKILL.md
```

### SKILL.md Format

A `SKILL.md` file has YAML frontmatter followed by markdown body content:

```yaml
---
name: debugging-cake
description: |
  How to investigate and debug issues with the cake CLI tool. Use this skill whenever:
  - The user reports the CLI returned "None" or an empty response
  - The user mentions truncated, incomplete, or cut-off responses
---

# Debugging cake CLI

## Step 1: Check the session file
...
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

  | Field         | Description                                                                                              |
  | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `name`        | Unique identifier for the skill (used for filtering and deduplication)                                   |
  | `description` | When and why to use this skill. This is shown in the catalog and guides the model's activation decision. |

### Body Content

The markdown body contains the actual instructions. It is lazy-loaded (read from disk only when the skill is activated via the `Read` tool), not stored in memory during discovery.

## Discovery

Skills are discovered from these locations, in precedence order:

1. **Project-level**: `{working_dir}/.agents/skills/`
2. **Configured paths**: directories listed in `skills.path`
3. **User-level**: `~/.agents/skills/`

### Discovery Rules

- Each subdirectory of `.agents/skills/` is checked for a `SKILL.md` file
- Excluded directories: `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `target/`
- Maximum scan depth: 4 levels
- Maximum directories scanned: 2000
- Name collisions within the same scope: first found wins
- Project skills override configured and user skills with the same name
- Configured skills override user skills with the same name
- Malformed skills produce diagnostics (logged as warnings/errors) but do not block other skills

### Example Discovery Output

```
Project: .agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md  ->  "debugging-cake"
Project: .agents/skills/evaluating-cake/SKILL.md  ->  "evaluating-cake"
User:    ~/.agents/skills/web-searching/SKILL.md   ->  "web-searching" (unless shadowed by project)
```

## Prompt Integration

Discovered skills appear in an initial developer context message as XML:

```xml
## Skills

<skill_instructions>
The following skills provide specialized instructions for specific tasks.
When a task matches a skill's description, use your file-read tool to load
the SKILL.md at the listed location before proceeding.
When a skill references relative paths, resolve them against the skill's
directory (the parent of SKILL.md) and use absolute paths in tool calls.
</skill_instructions>

<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>debugging-cake</name>
    <description>How to investigate and debug issues with the cake CLI tool...</description>
    <location>/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>evaluating-cake</name>
    <description>Evaluate cake CLI session performance...</description>
    <location>/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/evaluating-cake/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

The model sees this catalog and decides when to activate a skill based on the task at hand.

## Activation

When the model determines a skill is relevant, it calls the `Read` tool with the skill's `location` path. For example:

```json
{
  "path": "/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md"
}
```

The Read tool always returns the actual file contents, just like any other file. No interception, no content substitution.

### SkillActivated Records

When the Read tool targets a known skill path, cake emits a `SkillActivated` session record on the first read of that skill in the session. Subsequent reads of the same skill do not produce additional records.

The record is emitted by path-watching (checking the Read path against `skill_locations`) after the Read executes normally. The output is never substituted.

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

  | Flag                   | Description                                 |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | `--no-skills`          | Disable all skills for this session         |
  | `--skills name1,name2` | Only load specific skills (comma-separated) |

### Settings TOML

Add a `[skills]` section to `settings.toml`:

```toml
# Global: ~/.config/cake/settings.toml
# Project: .cake/settings.toml

[skills]
disabled = false
only = ["debugging-cake", "evaluating-cake"]
path = "~/my-skills:/shared/team-skills"
```

  | Field      | Description                                                                                                               |
  | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `disabled` | If `true`, disable all skills by default                                                                                  |
  | `only`     | List of skill names to load (empty = all)                                                                                 |
  | `path`     | Additional directories containing skills. Use colon-separated paths, semicolon on Windows, and `~` for the home directory |

### Precedence

Configuration is resolved with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. `--no-skills` CLI flag
2. `--skills name1,name2` CLI flag
3. `skills.only` in settings.toml
4. `skills.disabled = true` in settings.toml
5. Default: load all discovered skills

## Path Validation

Skill directories are automatically allowlisted for read access. The Read tool can access:

- The current working directory (read-write)
- Temp directories (read-write)
- Directories added via `--add-dir` (read-only)
- **Skill base directories** (read-only, automatically added)

This means the model can read skill files without needing `--add-dir` flags.

## Authoring Skills

To create a new skill:

1. Create a directory under `.agents/skills/` (project-level) or `~/.agents/skills/` (user-level)
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown body
3. Ensure the `name` and `description` fields are present

### Best Practices

- **Description is critical**: Write it as instructions to the model about when to use the skill
- **Be specific**: The description should mention concrete trigger conditions
- **Keep it focused**: One skill per domain/task
- **Use absolute paths**: When a skill references files, tell the model to resolve relative paths against the skill directory

### Example Skill

```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: |
  Use this skill when the user asks for a code review, asks to check code quality,
  or mentions reviewing a pull request or diff.

# Code Review Guidelines

## Checklist

- [ ] Does the code follow the project's style guide?
- [ ] Are error cases handled appropriately?
- [ ] Is there adequate test coverage?
- [ ] Are there any security concerns?

## Output Format

Provide findings as:
1. **Critical** - Must fix before merging
2. **Suggestions** - Recommended improvements
3. **Nits** - Minor style issues
```

## Implementation

Discovery, parsing, and catalog construction live in `config::skills` (`discover_skills`, `Skill`, `SkillCatalog`). The prompts module emits the `<available_skills>` XML as a developer context message, the tools module registers skill base directories for path validation, and the agent loop watches Read paths against `skill_locations` to emit `SkillActivated` records once per skill per session.
