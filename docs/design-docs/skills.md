# Agent Skills

This document describes the skills system that provides specialized instructions to the AI agent on demand.

## Overview

Skills are self-contained instruction modules stored as `SKILL.md` files. They allow the agent to access domain-specific knowledge (debugging procedures, evaluation criteria, workflow instructions) only when needed, rather than embedding all possible knowledge in the initial prompt.

The system has three phases:

1. **Discovery**: Find `SKILL.md` files in `.agents/skills/` directories
2. **Catalog disclosure**: List discovered skills in an initial developer context message
3. **Activation**: The model reads a `SKILL.md` via the `Read` tool when its description matches the task

## Skill Format

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.agents/skills/
  debugging-cake/
    SKILL.md
  evaluating-cake/
    SKILL.md
```

### SKILL.md Format

A `SKILL.md` file has YAML frontmatter followed by markdown body content:

```yaml
---
name: debugging-cake
description: |
  How to investigate and debug issues with the cake CLI tool. Use this skill whenever:
  - The user reports the CLI returned "None" or an empty response
  - The user mentions truncated, incomplete, or cut-off responses
---

# Debugging cake CLI

## Step 1: Check the session file
...
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier for the skill (used for filtering and deduplication) |
| `description` | When and why to use this skill. This is shown in the catalog and guides the model's activation decision. |

### Body Content

The markdown body contains the actual instructions. It is lazy-loaded (read from disk only when the skill is activated via the `Read` tool), not stored in memory during discovery.

## Discovery

Skills are discovered from these locations, in precedence order:

1. **Project-level**: `{working_dir}/.agents/skills/`
2. **Configured paths**: directories listed in `skills.path`
3. **User-level**: `~/.agents/skills/`

### Discovery Rules

- Each subdirectory of `.agents/skills/` is checked for a `SKILL.md` file
- Excluded directories: `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `target/`
- Maximum scan depth: 4 levels
- Maximum directories scanned: 2000
- Name collisions within the same scope: first found wins
- Project skills override configured and user skills with the same name
- Configured skills override user skills with the same name
- Malformed skills produce diagnostics (logged as warnings/errors) but do not block other skills

### Example Discovery Output

```
Project: .agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md  ->  "debugging-cake"
Project: .agents/skills/evaluating-cake/SKILL.md  ->  "evaluating-cake"
User:    ~/.agents/skills/web-searching/SKILL.md   ->  "web-searching" (unless shadowed by project)
```

## Prompt Integration

Discovered skills appear in an initial developer context message as XML:

```xml
## Skills

<skill_instructions>
The following skills provide specialized instructions for specific tasks.
When a task matches a skill's description, use your file-read tool to load
the SKILL.md at the listed location before proceeding.
When a skill references relative paths, resolve them against the skill's
directory (the parent of SKILL.md) and use absolute paths in tool calls.
</skill_instructions>

<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>debugging-cake</name>
    <description>How to investigate and debug issues with the cake CLI tool...</description>
    <location>/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
  <skill>
    <name>evaluating-cake</name>
    <description>Evaluate cake CLI session performance...</description>
    <location>/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/evaluating-cake/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

The model sees this catalog and decides when to activate a skill based on the task at hand.

## Activation

When the model determines a skill is relevant, it calls the `Read` tool with the skill's `location` path. For example:

```json
{
  "path": "/Users/alice/Projects/cake/.agents/skills/debugging-cake/SKILL.md"
}
```

For known skill locations, cake intercepts the Read call and returns the markdown body after frontmatter. The frontmatter metadata is already present in the catalog, so activation gives the model the instruction body it needs without duplicating metadata.

### Deduplication

Once a skill is activated in a session, re-reading it returns a lightweight message instead of the full content:

```
Skill 'debugging-cake' is already active in this session.
Its instructions are already in the conversation context.
```

This prevents token waste and duplicate instructions when:
- The model reads the same skill multiple times in one session
- A session is resumed or continued (activated skills are reconstructed from conversation history)

Deduplication works by:
1. Tracking skill locations (path -> name mapping) in the `Agent`
2. Maintaining an `activated_skills` set shared across concurrent tool executions
3. Checking the set before executing a Read on a known skill path
4. Reconstructing the set from session history when resuming/continuing

## Configuration

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--no-skills` | Disable all skills for this session |
| `--skills name1,name2` | Only load specific skills (comma-separated) |

### Settings TOML

Add a `[skills]` section to `settings.toml`:

```toml
# Global: ~/.config/cake/settings.toml
# Project: .cake/settings.toml

[skills]
disabled = false
only = ["debugging-cake", "evaluating-cake"]
path = "~/my-skills:/shared/team-skills"
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `disabled` | If `true`, disable all skills by default |
| `only` | List of skill names to load (empty = all) |
| `path` | Additional directories containing skills. Use colon-separated paths, semicolon on Windows, and `~` for the home directory |

### Precedence

Configuration is resolved with the following precedence (highest to lowest):

1. `--no-skills` CLI flag
2. `--skills name1,name2` CLI flag
3. `skills.only` in settings.toml
4. `skills.disabled = true` in settings.toml
5. Default: load all discovered skills

## Path Validation

Skill directories are automatically allowlisted for read access. The Read tool can access:

- The current working directory (read-write)
- Temp directories (read-write)
- Directories added via `--add-dir` (read-only)
- **Skill base directories** (read-only, automatically added)

This means the model can read skill files without needing `--add-dir` flags.

## Authoring Skills

To create a new skill:

1. Create a directory under `.agents/skills/` (project-level) or `~/.agents/skills/` (user-level)
2. Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown body
3. Ensure the `name` and `description` fields are present

### Best Practices

- **Description is critical**: Write it as instructions to the model about when to use the skill
- **Be specific**: The description should mention concrete trigger conditions
- **Keep it focused**: One skill per domain/task
- **Use absolute paths**: When a skill references files, tell the model to resolve relative paths against the skill directory

### Example Skill

```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: |
  Use this skill when the user asks for a code review, asks to check code quality,
  or mentions reviewing a pull request or diff.

# Code Review Guidelines

## Checklist

- [ ] Does the code follow the project's style guide?
- [ ] Are error cases handled appropriately?
- [ ] Is there adequate test coverage?
- [ ] Are there any security concerns?

## Output Format

Provide findings as:
1. **Critical** - Must fix before merging
2. **Suggestions** - Recommended improvements
3. **Nits** - Minor style issues
```

## Implementation

### Key Types

```rust
// src/config/skills.rs
pub struct Skill {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub location: PathBuf,
    pub base_directory: PathBuf,
    pub scope: SkillScope,
}

pub enum SkillScope {
    Project,
    User,
}

pub struct SkillCatalog {
    pub skills: Vec<Skill>,
    pub diagnostics: Vec<SkillDiagnostic>,
}

pub enum SkillConfig {
    All,
    Disabled,
    Only(Vec<String>),
}
```

### Key Functions

```rust
// Discover skills from filesystem
pub fn discover_skills(working_dir: &Path) -> SkillCatalog;

// Parse a SKILL.md file
impl Skill {
    pub fn parse(path: &Path, scope: SkillScope) -> Result<Self, SkillDiagnostic>;
}

// Generate XML catalog for prompt context
impl SkillCatalog {
    pub fn to_prompt_xml(&self) -> String;
    pub fn filter_to(&mut self, skill_names: &[String]);
}

// Resolve configuration from CLI and settings
impl SettingsLoader {
    pub fn resolve_skill_config(
        no_skills: bool,
        skills_flag: Option<&str>,
        settings: &SkillSettings,
    ) -> SkillConfig;
}
```

### Integration Flow

1. **`main.rs`**: Call `discover_skills()`, apply `SkillConfig`, pass catalog to `build_initial_prompt_messages()`
2. **`prompts/mod.rs`**: Emit `<available_skills>` XML in a developer context message if skills exist
3. **`tools/mod.rs`**: Register skill base directories for path validation via `set_skill_dirs()`
4. **`agent.rs`**: Check Read tool paths against `skill_locations`; deduplicate via `activated_skills`

## Testing

The skills system includes tests for:

- **Parsing**: Valid skills, malformed YAML, missing fields, multiline descriptions
- **Discovery**: Project skills, user skills, collision resolution, excluded directories, max depth
- **XML generation**: Format, escaping, empty catalog
- **Configuration precedence**: CLI flags override settings
- **Deduplication**: Same skill read twice returns lightweight message
