# Filesystem Sandbox

Cake sandboxes commands executed by the Bash tool to restrict filesystem access. This prevents LLM-generated commands from reading or writing files outside the project directory and essential system paths.

## Overview

When the Bash tool executes a command, cake wraps it in an OS-level sandbox that enforces a deny-default filesystem policy. Only explicitly allowed paths are accessible:

| Access Level | Paths | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Read-write** | Current working directory, temp directories, `~/.cargo`, `~/.rustup`, `~/.cache/sccache`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.config/glab-cli`, `~/.config/mise`, `~/.asdf`, `~/.volta`, and related cache/state directories | Project files, build artifacts, toolchain caches, SCM CLI configs |
| **Read-only + execute** | `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, system paths, `/Library`, `/System/Library`, `/Applications`, `/opt/homebrew`, `/opt/local` (macOS); `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc/alternatives`, `/snap` (Linux) | Running system tools and compilers |
| **Read-only** | `/etc`, `/dev`, `/var`, `/proc`, `/sys` (Linux); `/etc`, `/private/etc`, `/private/var`, `/dev`, `/var` (macOS); `~/.config/git`, `~/.gitattributes`; **plus any directories added via `--add-dir`**; **plus skill directories (parent dirs of SKILL.md files)** | Configuration, device access, git config, user-specified reference directories, skill scripts |
| **Denied** | Everything else | Home directory (except allowed paths), other projects, etc. |

## Platform Support

### macOS — sandbox-exec (Seatbelt)

On macOS, cake uses `sandbox-exec` with a dynamically generated [Seatbelt profile](https://reverse.put.as/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Apple-Sandbox-Guide-v1.0.pdf). The profile uses a deny-default policy and explicitly allows:

- **Filesystem**: read-write for cwd/temp/toolchain/SCM/runtime paths, read-only+exec for system paths, read-only for config/device paths
- **Process**: `process-fork`, `process-exec` (needed for bash and subcommands)
- **IPC**: `mach-lookup` (needed for dyld, DNS, system frameworks)
- **Signals**: allowed (needed for process management)
- **Network**: fully allowed (the sandbox restricts filesystem only, not network)
- **Devices**: `/dev` (read-only access to device files)
- **System**: `sysctl-read`, `file-ioctl` (needed for terminal operations)

Sandbox profiles are written to temporary files under `$TMPDIR/cake/sandbox_profiles/`.

Requires `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` (present on all standard macOS installations) and a
process context where macOS allows `sandbox-exec` to apply a Seatbelt profile.
Cake probes this at runtime. If the binary exists but profile application is
denied, Bash commands fail closed rather than running without cake's filesystem
sandbox. This commonly happens when cake itself is already running inside
another Seatbelt sandbox.

### Linux — Landlock LSM

On Linux, cake uses [Landlock](https://landlock.io/), a Linux Security Module available since kernel 5.13. Landlock allows unprivileged processes to sandbox themselves without root access.

The Landlock sandbox is applied via `pre_exec`, so rules take effect in the child process after `fork()` but before `exec()`.

**Important**: Landlock support must be compiled in explicitly:

```bash
cargo build --release --features landlock
```

With sandboxing enabled, Linux fails closed if cake was built without Landlock
support or if Landlock reports anything less than a fully enforced ruleset.
Use `CAKE_SANDBOX=off` as the explicit opt-out for unsandboxed Bash execution.

System paths on Linux include `/usr`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/etc/alternatives`, and `/snap`.

## Layered Defense

The sandbox provides OS-level filesystem restriction as the primary enforcement mechanism. In addition, the Bash tool includes a narrow pre-execution destructive command guard that blocks known-destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `rm -rf` outside literal `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` targets) before they reach the shell. This best-effort guard complements the sandbox by catching destructive operations that are technically allowed within the sandbox's permitted zones—for example, destructive git operations inside the repository directory. It is not a shell security policy engine. See [tools.md](./tools.md) for the full list of blocked commands.

## Configuration

### Disabling the Sandbox

Set the `CAKE_SANDBOX` environment variable to disable sandboxing:

```bash
# Any of these values disable the sandbox
export CAKE_SANDBOX=off
export CAKE_SANDBOX=0
export CAKE_SANDBOX=false
export CAKE_SANDBOX=no
```

When disabled, a warning is logged and all commands run with full filesystem access.

The `warn` value is recognized but currently falls back to enforce mode.

### Adding Read-Only Directories (--add-dir)

Use the `--add-dir` CLI flag to grant the agent read-only access to directories outside the project directory:

```bash
# Add a single directory
cake --add-dir /path/to/reference/docs "Use the documentation in /path/to/reference/docs"

# Add multiple directories
cake --add-dir ~/Documents/specs --add-dir ~/Projects/shared-utils "Analyze the code"
```

**Key points:**

- Directories are added as **read-only** — the agent cannot write to them
- The flag can be repeated to add multiple directories
- Invalid or non-existent directories are logged as warnings and ignored
- Both the original path and its canonical (symlink-resolved) path are added to ensure access

This is useful when you want the agent to:
- Reference documentation or specifications stored elsewhere
- Read shared utility code from another project
- Access configuration files or templates

### Persistent Read-Write Directories (settings.toml)

Use the `directories` key in `settings.toml` to declare directories that cake can read from and write to. Unlike `--add-dir` which grants read-only access, directories listed here get full read-write access. This is useful for configuring persistent workspace directories.

**Global settings** (`~/.config/cake/settings.toml`):

```toml
directories = ["~/Projects", "~/Documents/notes"]
```

**Project settings** (`.cake/settings.toml`):

```toml
directories = ["../shared-libs", "/data/exports"]
```

**Key points:**

- Directories are added as **read-write** — the agent can create, modify, and delete files
- Lists from global and project settings are **merged** (union with deduplication)
- Non-existent directories are logged as warnings and ignored
- Both the original path and its canonical (symlink-resolved) path are added to the sandbox

### Additional Read-Write Paths

The sandbox automatically includes:

- The current working directory (and its subtree)
- System temp directories (`$TMPDIR`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`)
- User toolchain paths (`$CARGO_HOME` or `~/.cargo`, `$RUSTUP_HOME` or `~/.rustup`)
- SCM CLI paths: `~/.config/gh`, `~/.cache/gh`, `~/.local/share/gh`, `~/.local/state/gh`, `~/.config/glab-cli`, `~/.cache/glab-cli`, `~/.local/share/glab-cli`, `~/.local/state/glab-cli`
- Runtime manager paths: `~/.config/mise`, `~/.local/share/mise`, `~/.local/state/mise`, `~/.cache/mise`, `~/.asdf`, `~/.volta`
- sccache paths: `~/.cache/sccache`, `~/Library/Caches/sccache` (macOS)

All read-write paths are canonicalized (symlinks resolved) before being added to the sandbox policy.

## Examples

```bash
# This works — reading files in the project directory
cake "List the files in this project"
# Bash tool runs: ls -la  ✓

# This is blocked — writing outside the project directory
# Bash tool runs: touch /tmp/cake_test  ✗ (Operation not permitted)

# This is blocked — reading the user's home directory
# Bash tool runs: ls ~/Desktop  ✗ (Operation not permitted)

# This works — running system tools
# Bash tool runs: git status  ✓
# Bash tool runs: cargo build  ✓
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command fails with "Operation not permitted"

The sandbox is blocking access to a path outside the allowed set. Options:

1. Ensure you're running cake from the correct project directory
2. If the command legitimately needs broader access, disable the sandbox with `CAKE_SANDBOX=off`

### "sandbox-exec not found" error (macOS)

The `sandbox-exec` binary is missing from `/usr/bin/`. This is unusual on
standard macOS installations. Bash commands fail closed unless sandboxing is
explicitly disabled with `CAKE_SANDBOX=off`.

### "sandbox-exec cannot apply profiles" error (macOS)

The `sandbox-exec` binary exists, but macOS rejected applying a test Seatbelt
profile in this process context. The most common cause is nested sandboxing:
cake was started by another sandboxed tool, and macOS does not allow that process
to apply another Seatbelt profile. Bash commands fail closed. Run cake from a
normal terminal to preserve sandbox enforcement, or set `CAKE_SANDBOX=off` when
intentionally running without cake's filesystem sandbox.

### "Landlock feature not enabled" error (Linux)

Rebuild with the Landlock feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features landlock
```

### Sandbox not enforced on older Linux kernels

Landlock requires kernel 5.13 or later. On older kernels, Landlock reports `NotEnforced` status and Bash commands fail closed unless sandboxing is explicitly disabled with `CAKE_SANDBOX=off`. Cake also fails closed when Landlock reports `PartiallyEnforced`, because the filesystem sandbox is treated as unavailable unless the ruleset is fully enforced. Check your kernel version with `uname -r`.

### SSH git operations fail with host key verification

The sandbox grants read-only access to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` so the sandboxed process cannot modify it. If you use SSH for git operations (e.g., `git clone git@github.com:...`), you need to populate `known_hosts` before running cake. Choose one of the following approaches:

**Option 1: Pre-populate known_hosts with ssh-keyscan**

Run once to fetch host keys for common providers:

```bash
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519,rsa github.com gitlab.com bitbucket.org >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

Add any self-hosted or additional git servers the same way:

```bash
ssh-keyscan -t ed25519,rsa your-git-server.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

**Option 2: Use StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new**

Add to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host github.com gitlab.com bitbucket.org
    StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
```

This auto-accepts host keys on first connection, then pins them for future connections. Works for any host you add. This is the more flexible option since it handles new hosts without manual pre-population.
