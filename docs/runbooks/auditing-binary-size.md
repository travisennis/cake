# Auditing Binary Size

Analyze the cake release binary to understand size contributors and identify optimization opportunities.

## Prerequisites

Install the repository development tools with `just setup`, then install the audit-specific `cargo-bloat` utility:

```bash
cargo install cargo-bloat
```

## Workflow

### 1. Build the release binary and check current size

```bash
just build
ls -lh target/release/cake
```

### 2. Analyze size by crate

Shows which dependencies contribute the most to the `.text` section:

```bash
cargo bloat --release --crates
```

### 3. Analyze size by function

Shows the largest individual functions:

```bash
cargo bloat --release -n 30
```

`cargo bloat` may report the size of an analysis artifact that differs from the normal stripped release binary. Run `just build` again before reporting `target/release/cake` as the shipped binary size.

### 4. Review findings

The typical size breakdown for this project:

  | Category              | Typical Contributors                                                         |
  | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **TLS/Networking**    | `aws_lc_sys`, `rustls`, `h2`, `hyper`, `reqwest` — usually the largest chunk |
  | **Standard library**  | `std` — unavoidable baseline                                                 |
  | **Schema validation** | `jsonschema`, `referencing`, `fancy_regex`, `regex_*`                        |
  | **Async runtime**     | `tokio` — moderate                                                           |
  | **CLI framework**     | `clap_builder` — moderate                                                    |
  | **Application code**  | `cake`                                                                       |
  | **Other deps**        | `similar`, `serde_json`, `tracing_subscriber`, etc.                          |

### 5. Check for easy wins

- **Symbols stripped?** The release profile should have `strip = true`. If not, that's \~1.3 MB of free savings with no performance cost (only downside: raw addresses in panic backtraces instead of function names).
- **Panic strategy set?** The release profile currently uses `panic = "abort"` for smaller binaries.
- **Tokio features minimal?** The project currently uses `features = ["full"]`. If auditing for size regressions, check whether narrower features can support the current async, process, IO, signal, and macro usage before changing this.
- **Unused dependencies?** Run `cargo machete` to detect unused deps (install with `cargo install cargo-machete`).

### 6. Compare over time

To track whether binary size is growing, compare before and after changes:

```bash
ls -lh target/release/cake
cargo bloat --release --crates | head -20
```

**What counts as a regression?** This project does not currently track a committed binary-size baseline, so judgment is required. Sensible heuristics (not measured from this project --- treat as starting points to discuss with the maintainer, not hard gates):

- A noticeable relative jump (rule of thumb: more than a few percent) in one change usually signals a new dependency or a wider feature set.
- A noticeable absolute jump (rule of thumb: hundreds of KB or more) is worth investigating even if relative growth is small.
- A single crate moving meaningfully up the `cargo bloat --crates` list warrants checking whether new features were enabled or a heavier dependency was pulled in.

If the project later commits a `binary-size-baseline.txt` or similar artifact, prefer comparing against it over these heuristics.

Capture a local baseline before starting work so the comparison is meaningful:

```bash
just build
ls -lh target/release/cake > /tmp/cake-size-before.txt
cargo bloat --release --crates | head -20 > /tmp/cake-bloat-before.txt
# ... make changes ...
just build
diff /tmp/cake-size-before.txt <(ls -lh target/release/cake)
diff /tmp/cake-bloat-before.txt <(cargo bloat --release --crates | head -20)
```

## Current Release Profile

The release profile lives in [`Cargo.toml`](../../Cargo.toml). Inspect it directly rather than relying on a copy here:

```bash
awk '/^\[profile.release\]/,/^$/' Cargo.toml
```

At time of writing it includes `lto`, `codegen-units`, `panic`, and `strip` settings. If any of those are missing or changed unexpectedly, that is the first place to look for size regressions or easy wins.

## Key Tradeoffs to Be Aware Of

- **`rustls` vs `native-tls`**: `rustls` bundles \~1 MB of crypto (`aws_lc_sys` + `rustls`). Switching to `native-tls` uses the OS TLS stack (smaller binary) but introduces platform-dependent build behavior, especially on Linux with OpenSSL.
- **`opt-level = "z"`**: Optimizes for size over speed. Not recommended unless binary size is critical.
- **`strip = true`**: Only downside is panic backtraces show raw addresses instead of function names. Logs via `tracing` are unaffected.
- **`panic = "abort"`**: Reduces unwind machinery. The tradeoff is no stack unwinding or panic recovery.
