# cake

cake is a minimal coding harness for headless usage in the terminal. It's not a TUI — it's a Unix filter for AI. It takes input, does work, produces output, and exits. That's its strength: cake is composable with every tool in your shell.

## Installation

To install cake, you'll need Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/travisennis/cake.git
   cd cake
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. The binary will be available in `target/release/cake`

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage with a prompt
cake "Implement a binary search tree in Rust"

# Pipe file content with instructions
cat src/main.rs | cake "Explain this code"

# Use a heredoc for multi-line prompts
cake << 'EOF'
Implement a function that:
1. Takes a list of numbers
2. Returns the sum
EOF

# Heredoc with prompt prefix
cake "Review this code:" << 'EOF'
fn main() {
    println!("Hello");
}
EOF

# Input redirection
cake < prompt.txt

# Read from stdin explicitly
cake - < file.txt

# With max tokens override
cake --max-tokens 4000 "Your prompt here"
```

### Shell Pipelines

cake reads from stdin, so it composes naturally with other Unix tools:
When a prompt argument and stdin are both present, cake sends them as separate labeled sections so the prompt stays distinct from the piped content.

```bash
# Code review from git diff
git diff HEAD~3 | cake "Summarize these changes for a changelog entry"

# Explain a file
cat src/main.rs | cake "Explain this code"

# Review staged changes
git diff --staged | cake "Code review these staged changes"
```

### Multi-file Context

Use heredocs with command substitution to feed multiple files as context:

```bash
cake << 'EOF'
Here are two files. Explain how they interact:
--- agent.rs ---
$(cat src/clients/agent.rs)
--- types.rs ---
$(cat src/clients/types.rs)
EOF
```

## Configuration

cake requires at least one model configured in `settings.toml`, plus an API key for that model's provider. Set the API key as the environment variable named by the model's `api_key_env` field.

#### Environment Variables

| Variable        | Description                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CAKE_DATA_DIR` | Override cache and session directories (default: cache at `~/.cache/cake/`, sessions at `~/.local/share/cake/sessions/`) |
| `CAKE_SANDBOX`  | Set to `off` to disable filesystem sandboxing                                                                            |

### Model Configuration

Model settings can be configured via:

1. **Settings TOML**: Define named models in `settings.toml` files
2. **Environment variables**: Set the API key env var named by each model's `api_key_env`
3. **CLI flags**: `--model` to select a named model, `--max-tokens` to override

#### Settings TOML

Create a `settings.toml` file to define custom model configurations:

- **Project-level**: `.cake/settings.toml` in your project directory
- **Global**: `~/.config/cake/settings.toml` for system-wide settings

```toml
# Example settings.toml
default_model = "claude"           # Optional; enables running cake without --model

[[models]]
name = "claude"                    # Use with --model claude
model = "anthropic/claude-4.6-sonnet"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
api_type = "responses"
temperature = 0.7

[[models]]
name = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
api_key_env = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
top_p = 0.9

[[models]]
name = "o4-mini"
model = "openai/o4-mini"
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
api_type = "responses"
reasoning_effort = "high"          # none|low|medium|high|xhigh
reasoning_summary = "concise"      # concise|detailed|auto (Responses API only)

[[models]]
name = "claude-reasoning"
model = "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/"
api_key_env = "OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
api_type = "responses"
reasoning_max_tokens = 8000        # Budget-style for Anthropic via OpenRouter

[skills]
path = "~/my-skills:/shared/team-skills"
```

```bash
# Use a named model from settings.toml
cake --model claude "Your prompt here"

# Without --model, uses the configured default_model
cake "Your prompt here"

# Apply a behavior profile from settings.toml
cake --profile review "Your prompt here"
```

See `.cake/settings.toml` for a complete example.

#### Profiles

Profiles are named behavior overlays in `settings.toml`. They can change `default_model`, skill filtering, and persistent read-write directories without redefining model provider configs.

```toml
[profiles.fast]
default_model = "deepseek"

[profiles.review.skills]
only = ["debugging-cake", "evaluating-cake"]

[profiles.expanded]
directories = ["../shared-libs"]
```

When `--profile <name>` is passed, cake applies top-level global settings, top-level project settings, then the selected global and project profile. CLI flags such as `--model`, `--skills`, and `--no-skills` still win.

#### Reasoning Configuration

Models that support reasoning (e.g., OpenAI o-series, Anthropic Claude with extended thinking) can be configured with these fields:

| Field                  | Description                                      | Values                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `reasoning_effort`     | Controls how much reasoning the model performs   | `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` |
| `reasoning_summary`    | How reasoning is summarized (Responses API only) | `concise`, `detailed`, `auto`            |
| `reasoning_max_tokens` | Token budget for reasoning (budget-style)        | Any positive integer                     |

These can also be overridden at runtime with CLI flags:

```bash
# Override reasoning effort for a single run
cake --reasoning-effort high "Solve this math problem"

# Set a reasoning token budget
cake --reasoning-budget 4000 "Analyze this code"

# Combine with a named model
cake --model claude --reasoning-effort medium "Explain this algorithm"
```

#### Default Model

cake does not include a built-in default model. To run `cake "prompt"` without `--model`, set `default_model` to the name of a configured model:

```toml
default_model = "zen"

[[models]]
name = "zen"
model = "glm-5.1"
base_url = "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/"
api_key_env = "OPENCODE_ZEN_API_TOKEN"
```

If neither `--model` nor `default_model` is provided, cake exits with setup instructions.

### Session Management

cake automatically saves conversation sessions so you can continue conversations across separate invocations. Sessions are tracked per directory.

```bash
# Start a conversation
cake "Remember the number 42"

# Continue the most recent session in the current directory
cake --continue "What number did I tell you?"

# Resume a specific session by UUID
cake --resume 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 "Continue our conversation"

# Fork the latest session (creates new session with same history)
cake --fork "Let's discuss something different"

# Fork a specific session by UUID
cake --fork 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 "New branch of conversation"
```

Sessions are saved to `~/.local/share/cake/sessions/` (or `$CAKE_DATA_DIR/sessions/` if set) as flat `{uuid}.jsonl` files. Each file includes full conversation history with metadata. Sessions are saved on both success and error for crash recovery.

The `--output-format stream-json` output is a live task stream, not a resumable session file. It never emits session metadata; use the persisted session UUID with `--resume <uuid>`. The `--output-format json` mode outputs a single JSON summary object at completion (result, usage, session path, turns, elapsed time) for scripting and CI integration.

For more details, see [Session Management](docs/design-docs/session-management.md).

#### Branching Conversations

Think of session management as branches of thought:

- **`--continue`** is your "keep going" — great for multi-step tasks where cake needs to iterate.
- **`--fork`** is your "what if?" — try a different approach without losing the original thread.
- **`--resume <UUID>`** is your "go back to that idea from Tuesday."
- **`--no-session`** is for throwaway questions that don't pollute your session history.

### Worktrees

Run a task in an isolated git worktree so changes don't affect your main working directory. The worktree is created at `<repo>/.cake/worktrees/<name>` on a new branch based on the default remote branch.

```bash
# Named worktree
cake -w feature-auth "Add auth middleware"

# Auto-generated name
cake -w "Fix the bug"
```

When the task finishes, cake automatically removes the worktree if no changes were made. If there are uncommitted changes or new commits, the worktree is kept so you can return to it later.

### Filesystem Sandbox

Commands executed by the Bash tool run inside an OS-level filesystem sandbox that restricts access to only the project directory and essential system paths. This prevents LLM-generated commands from reading or writing files outside the allowed set.

- **macOS**: Uses `sandbox-exec` with a deny-default Seatbelt profile
- **Linux**: Uses Landlock LSM (kernel 5.13+, requires `--features landlock`)

Linux Bash execution fails closed when sandboxing is enabled but cake was built
without Landlock support, or when Landlock cannot fully enforce the filesystem
ruleset. The sandbox can be disabled explicitly by setting `CAKE_SANDBOX=off`.

#### Destructive Command Protection

The Bash tool also has a best-effort destructive command guard before execution, covering destructive git operations (`git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, `git clean -f`, etc.) and `rm -rf` outside literal `/tmp` or `/var/tmp` targets. This guard is not a shell security policy engine; the OS sandbox is the filesystem enforcement boundary. A blocked command returns an error explaining the reason and suggesting a safe alternative.

#### Adding Read-Only Directories

Use `--add-dir` to grant the agent read-only access to directories outside the project:

```bash
# Allow the agent to read from a shared library directory
cake --add-dir /path/to/shared/libs "Use the utilities in /path/to/shared/libs"

# Multiple directories can be added
cake --add-dir ~/Documents/references --add-dir ~/Projects/shared "Review the code"
```

The agent will be able to **read** files from these directories but **not write** to them.

For persistent read-write access, add directories to `settings.toml`:

```toml
# In ~/.config/cake/settings.toml (global) or .cake/settings.toml (project)
directories = ["~/Projects", "~/Documents/notes"]
```

Directories from global and project settings are merged. These directories get full read-write access and persist across sessions.

For more details, see [Filesystem Sandbox](docs/design-docs/sandbox.md).

### AGENTS.md — Per-Project AI Behavior

cake reads `AGENTS.md` files to shape its behavior without re-prompting every time:

- **`~/.cake/AGENTS.md`** — Global personality, preferences, and conventions applied to all projects.
- **`~/.config/AGENTS.md`** — XDG-standard location for global instructions.
- **`./AGENTS.md`** — Project-level instructions: tech stack, coding standards, domain knowledge.

This is how you make cake a domain expert. For example, a project-level `AGENTS.md` might say:

```markdown
This is a Rust project using Tokio for async. Use `anyhow` for errors.
Always run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` after editing Rust files.
Never use `unwrap()` in production code.
```

### System Prompt Customization

cake uses a built-in system prompt that tells the model it is a coding agent and how to use its tools. You can replace this prompt with your own by creating a `system.md` file:

- **Project-level**: `.cake/system.md` in your project directory — applies to that project only
- **User-level**: `~/.config/cake/system.md` — applies to all projects

Project-level overrides take precedence over user-level. If neither file exists, the built-in default is used. Custom files **replace** the default prompt entirely; they do not append to it.

An empty `system.md` file is valid and results in no system prompt (the model receives only the AGENTS.md context, skills, and environment messages).

The built-in default prompt is in `src/prompts/system.md` in the source repository.

### Shell Aliases and Functions

Set up shell aliases to turn common patterns into one-liners:

```bash
# Quick aliases
alias review='git diff --staged | cake "Code review these staged changes"'
alias explain='cake "Explain this code:" < '
alias changelog='git log --oneline HEAD~10..HEAD | cake "Write a changelog from these commits"'

# Multi-model comparison
compare() { cake --no-session --model glm "$1" & cake --no-session --model qwen "$1" & wait; }
```

### Machine-Readable Output

The `--output-format stream-json` mode emits NDJSON events for every conversation item, turning cake into a **backend for any frontend**. You can build a tmux-pane viewer, a web UI, or a VS Code extension that consumes the stream.

```bash
cake --output-format stream-json "List files" | jq '.type'
```

See [Streaming JSON Output](docs/design-docs/streaming-json-output.md) for the full schema.

The `--output-format json` mode prints a single JSON summary object at completion for scripting and CI:

```bash
cake --output-format json "Fix the bug" | jq '{result, usage, turns, elapsed_time}'
```

### Exit Codes

cake uses structured exit codes so that shell scripts and CI pipelines can distinguish between failure modes:

| Code | Meaning     | Description                                               |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success     | The agent completed and produced a response               |
| `1`  | Agent error | The model or a tool encountered an error during execution |
| `2`  | API error   | Rate limit, auth failure, or network error                |
| `3`  | Input error | No prompt provided, invalid flags, missing API key        |

```bash
# Use exit codes in scripts
if cake "Fix the bug"; then
    echo "Success"
else
    code=$?
    case $code in
        1) echo "Agent error" ;;
        2) echo "API error" ;;
        3) echo "Input error" ;;
    esac
fi
```

### Options

- `[PROMPT]` - Your instruction prompt as a positional argument (use `-` to read from stdin)
- `--max-tokens` - Set maximum tokens in response
- `--output-format` - Output format: `text` (default), `stream-json`, or `json`
- `--model <NAME>` - Select a named model from settings.toml
- `--profile <NAME>` - Apply a named behavior profile from settings.toml
- `--continue` - Continue the most recent session for the current directory
- `--resume <UUID>` - Resume a specific session by UUID
- `--fork [UUID]` - Fork a session (copy history into new session), optionally specify a UUID
- `--no-session` - Do not save the session to disk
- `--worktree` (`-w`) - Run in an isolated git worktree (optionally provide a name)
- `--reasoning-effort <EFFORT>` - Override reasoning effort level (none, low, medium, high, xhigh)
- `--reasoning-budget <TOKENS>` - Override reasoning token budget
- `--add-dir <DIR>` - Add a directory to the sandbox config (read-only access). Can be repeated.

### Example

```

## Architecture

cake follows a layered architecture with strict dependency flow:

1. **CLI Layer**: Argument parsing and user interaction
2. **Clients Layer**: AI service integration, tool execution, and conversation orchestration
3. **Config/Models/Prompts Layer**: Data persistence, core types, and prompt generation

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
