description: Run a focused review-readiness pass on a nearly finished change before commit. Scales the review to change size (XS/S = one pass, M = two passes, L/XL = three sequential passes covering rules conformance, type safety, and overengineering). Then synthesize and apply the worthwhile fixes.

# Deslop

Use this skill after a change is functionally correct and before commit or
handoff. The PR, commit text, task notes, and final response should describe
already-deslopped code.

## Goals

Leave the smallest clear diff that still solves the issue. Run focused
review passes instead of one subjective read. Preserve behavior while
improving readability, type safety, and alignment with repo rules.

## Scale the review to the change size

Pick an effort level from the diff before reading anything else:

```bash
git diff --stat
```

| Change size                                     | Required context           | Review passes        | Compliance note |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------- |
| **XS** (docs/skill/config only, ≤2 files)       | Root AGENTS.md if relevant | One combined pass    | One line        |
| **S** (single module, ≤~50 LOC, no public API)  | Root AGENTS.md, nearest nested AGENTS.md | One combined pass    | One line        |
| **M** (multi-file, ≤~200 LOC, no cross-module)  | + active task file, ExecPlan if one exists | Pass 1 + Pass 2      | Short block     |
| **L/XL** (cross-module, public API, agent loop, sandbox, sessions, API backends, tool execution) | + design docs and ADRs in the changed area | All three passes     | Full block      |

Only read context items that are relevant to the changed surface. Discover
them with targeted commands, e.g. `rg --files -g AGENTS.md`,
`rg --files docs/design-docs docs/adr`, `git diff -- <paths>`.

Required context items, in priority order:

- repo root `AGENTS.md`
- nested `AGENTS.md` files for the changed areas
- `.agents/TASKS.md`, `.agents/.tasks/index.md`, and the active task file
  when the work came from a task
- the relevant active exec plan when one exists for the current work
  (see `.agents/exec-plans/active/`)
- `.agents/PLANS.md` and `docs/design-docs/index.md` for L/XL changes
- any design doc or ADR directly relevant to the changed area
- the changed files and enough nearby context to review them

## Review passes

Treat each pass as a clean read with its own focus. Do not blur findings
across passes.

### Pass 1: Rules and documentation conformance

- Are we following `AGENTS.md`, nested `AGENTS.md`, and design docs?
- Did we drift from documented repo patterns or ownership boundaries?
- If the work came from a task or ExecPlan, does the implementation match
  its acceptance notes and recorded decisions?
- Did we update task, ExecPlan, design doc, or ADR notes when the change
  discovered something durable?

### Pass 2: Type safety and source of truth

This pass is about *Rust-level* code quality at the changed surface.
The repo-wide rules (`anyhow`/`thiserror` split, no `unwrap` in
production paths, no `#[allow(dead_code)]`, dead-code suppression policy,
binary-only crate shape) are documented in `AGENTS.md` — defer to that
file rather than restating it here.

Focus questions:

- Are we preserving canonical types, or did we clone, stringify, parse, or
  convert instead of carrying the existing typed value?
- Did we introduce stringly typed sentinels or `serde_json::Value` plumbing
  where a typed struct or enum should be used?
- Are fallible APIs explicit about failure, with useful context and without
  swallowing serialization, session, sandbox, or tool execution errors?
- Are async boundaries clear, with no blocking filesystem or process work
  added inside latency-sensitive Tokio paths unless nearby code already
  accepts it?
- Are OpenAI-compatible API boundaries, tool argument parsing, session
  records, and config files validated at the boundary and then represented
  with repo-owned types downstream?
- Could a mistake slip to runtime that Rust, serde, or a narrower
  enum/struct could catch at compile time?

### Pass 3: Overengineering and simplification

- Did we write more code than needed?
- Did we create helpers, abstractions, factories, wrappers, or indirection
  without enough payoff?
- Could the same result be expressed more directly?
- Are new modules, traits, builders, or generic helpers justified by real
  reuse or by an existing design boundary?

## Between-pass hygiene

Ground each pass in narrow local evidence. Use the smallest check that fits
the change:

- `git diff --stat` and `git diff -- <paths>` to keep review anchored
- `cargo fmt --check` or `cargo fmt` when formatting is affected
- `cargo test <module_or_test_name>` for focused tests in the changed area
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` or
  `just clippy-strict` when lint behavior, public types, or shared code
  changed
- `just ci` after code/config/dependency changes are complete, per
  `AGENTS.md`

For docs-only or skill-only edits, verify rendered Markdown and links by
inspection or `rg --files`; full CI is not required.

## Synthesis

After running the passes for the chosen scale, synthesize into one balanced
report with these headings:

- "How did we do?"
- "Feedback to keep"
- "Feedback to ignore"
- "Plan of attack"
- "Deslop compliance" (skip for XS; one line for S; short block for M;
  full block for L/XL — see template below)

## What to fix automatically

In an unattended implementation flow, apply worthwhile feedback before
commit. Prioritize:

- type drift, unnecessary cloning/string conversion, duplicated type defs
- violations of documented repo boundaries or design documents
- dead helpers, dead code, debug leftovers, placeholder text
- new `unwrap`, `expect`, `todo!`, `dbg!`, or broad lint suppressions
- errors lacking actionable context at CLI/API/session/sandbox/tool
  boundaries
- unnecessary wrappers or indirection removable locally without widening
  scope

Leave out feedback that is speculative, conflicts across passes, or would
widen scope materially. Mention it briefly in the synthesis.

## Compliance note

Make the chosen context auditable. Length scales with change size.

**XS / S example:**

```markdown
### Deslop compliance
- XS docs-only change to one skill file. Root AGENTS.md skim only; no
  nested AGENTS.md under the changed path; no CI required.
```

**M / L / XL template:**

```markdown
### Deslop compliance

- Root AGENTS.md: read
- Nested AGENTS.md: <paths or "none under changed paths">
- Task context: <task id> / not applicable because <reason>
- ExecPlan: <plan id> / not applicable because <reason>
- Design docs: <docs> / not applicable because <reason>
- ADRs: <adrs> / not applicable because <reason>
- Changed files and diff: reviewed via `git diff --stat` and targeted diffs
- Validation: <commands run>
```

Do not write blanket "no design docs to check" claims unless you actually
looked for a relevant one and can explain why the changed area has no
design-doc surface.

## Steps

1. Run `git diff --stat`. Pick a scale from the table.
2. Read only the required-context items for that scale.
3. Run the review passes for that scale, with a narrow evidence check
   between them.
4. Synthesize findings into the balanced report.
5. Apply worthwhile feedback that is clearly in scope.
6. Rerun the narrowest affected validation, then `just ci` when the
   finished work changed code, config, or dependencies.
7. Update task notes, ExecPlan notes, commit text, and PR/final response to
   describe the post-deslop state.

## Stop rules

- Do not turn this into a refactor unrelated to the ticket.
- Do not churn stable code outside the changed area just to make it
  prettier.
- If a cleanup is subjective and not clearly better, leave it alone.
- Do not blindly apply every finding from every pass.
- Do not run broad or slow checks repeatedly when a focused test already
  covers the current pass; save `just ci` for final validation.
- Do not escalate the scale beyond what the diff justifies just to feel
  thorough.
