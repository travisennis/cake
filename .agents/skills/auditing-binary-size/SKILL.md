# Auditing Binary Size

Analyze the cake release binary to understand size contributors and identify optimization opportunities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure `cargo-bloat` is installed:

```bash
cargo install cargo-bloat
```

## Workflow

### 1. Build the release binary and check current size

```bash
cargo build --release
ls -lh target/release/cake
```

### 2. Analyze size by crate

Shows which dependencies contribute the most to the `.text` section:

```bash
cargo bloat --release --crates
```

### 3. Analyze size by function

Shows the largest individual functions:

```bash
cargo bloat --release -n 30
```

### 4. Review findings

The typical size breakdown for this project:

  | Category             | Typical Contributors                                                         |
  | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **TLS/Networking**   | `aws_lc_sys`, `rustls`, `h2`, `hyper`, `reqwest` — usually the largest chunk |
  | **Standard library** | `std` — unavoidable baseline                                                 |
  | **Async runtime**    | `tokio` — moderate                                                           |
  | **CLI framework**    | `clap_builder` — moderate                                                    |
  | **Application code** | `cake` — relatively small                                                    |
  | **Other deps**       | `similar`, `regex_*`, `serde_json`, `tracing_subscriber`, etc.               |

### 5. Check for easy wins

- **Symbols stripped?** The release profile should have `strip = true`. If not, that's ~1.3 MB of free savings with no performance cost (only downside: raw addresses in panic backtraces instead of function names).
- **Panic strategy set?** The release profile currently uses `panic = "abort"` for smaller binaries.
- **Tokio features minimal?** The project currently uses `features = ["full"]`. If auditing for size regressions, check whether narrower features can support the current async, process, IO, signal, and macro usage before changing this.
- **Unused dependencies?** Run `cargo machete` to detect unused deps (install with `cargo install cargo-machete`).

### 6. Compare over time

To track whether binary size is growing, compare before and after changes:

```bash
ls -lh target/release/cake
cargo bloat --release --crates | head -20
```

## Current Release Profile

The release profile in `Cargo.toml` should include these optimizations:

```toml
[profile.release]
lto = true          # Link-time optimization (slower build, smaller/faster binary)
codegen-units = 1   # Single codegen unit (slower build, better optimization)
panic = "abort"     # Smaller binary; panics abort instead of unwinding
strip = true        # Strip symbols (free size reduction, ~1.3 MB savings)
```

## Key Tradeoffs to Be Aware Of

- **`rustls` vs `native-tls`**: `rustls` bundles ~1 MB of crypto (`aws_lc_sys` + `rustls`). Switching to `native-tls` uses the OS TLS stack (smaller binary) but introduces platform-dependent build behavior, especially on Linux with OpenSSL.
- **`opt-level = "z"`**: Optimizes for size over speed. Not recommended unless binary size is critical.
- **`strip = true`**: Only downside is panic backtraces show raw addresses instead of function names. Logs via `tracing` are unaffected.
- **`panic = "abort"`**: Reduces unwind machinery. The tradeoff is no stack unwinding or panic recovery.
